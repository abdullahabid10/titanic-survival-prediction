# Titanic Survival Prediction
This notebook gives a step-by-step approach to dealing with the [Titanic dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) in a simple and clean manner, making it easier for everyone to understand (even beginners). Also, the code is well-commented and there are detailed explanations along the way.

The notebook covers all of the major steps that are performed in a data science project life cycle:
* Obtain/Read Data
* Data Cleaning
* Feature Engineering
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Model Building & Evaluation

The following machine learning algorithms have been implemented (along with the train and test/submission scores):
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- k Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Model Stacking
